# SQL Server Installation

## Installation of SQL Server 2016 Developer Edition
These instructions are meant for learning SQL Server, not for a production installation.
1. This version is available for free when you sign up for Visual Studio Dev Essentials. Once signed up for Dev Essentials, download SQL Server 2016 Dev Edition. There is also a version with Service Pack 1. I had problems getting the file to work, so I recommend starting with the original and applying SP1 as a second step.
2. The SQL Server Developer Edition file is an ISO file. Double-click the file top open it. Double-click the Setup Icon.

## Attach AdventureWorksLT database
This database is used in the EdX course. The available file is an MDF file, which is an actual database file. It will be attached to the SQL Server, not restored.
1. Download the [AdventureWorks2012LT database file](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks).
2. Copy the file to this location `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL
Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA` . If you have a named instance, the path will be slightly different. Replace MSSQLSERVER with the instance name.
![screenshot23](../../_static/images/screenshots/week1/sqlserverinstall/screenshot23.jpg)
3. Locate SQL Server Management Studio and run it. You will probably want to create a shortcut in the taskbar or desktop because you will be using this program often.
![screenshot24](../../_static/images/screenshots/week1/sqlserverinstall/screenshot24.jpg)
4. Connect to the instance of SQL Server that you installed and click Connect.
![screenshot25](../../_static/images/screenshots/week1/sqlserverinstall/screenshot25.jpg)
