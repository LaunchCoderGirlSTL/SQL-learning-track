# How to Restore a Database

These instructions cover how to restore a .BAK file to a SQL Server. NOTE: A file from a later version of SQL Server cannot be restored on an earlier version.

## Extract a ZIP file
If the backup file happens to be compressed, you will need to uncompress it first. Right-click on the zip file and select Extract All.

## Launch SSMS
SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) will be the main tool you will use in this course. Find it by typing SSMS in the Search window. Itâ€™s a great idea to pin SSMS to the taskbar so you can find it more easily later.

## Connect to Your SQL Server Instance
1. Connect to the instance of SQL Server that you installed. Usually this will be LOCALHOST. Make sure that Windows Authentication is selected. Click Connect.
