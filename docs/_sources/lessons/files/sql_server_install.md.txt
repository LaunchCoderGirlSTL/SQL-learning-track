# SQL Server Installation

## Installation of SQL Server 2016 Developer Edition
These instructions are meant for learning SQL Server, not for a production installation.
1. This version is available for free when you sign up for Visual Studio Dev Essentials. Once signed up for Dev Essentials, download SQL Server 2016 Dev Edition. There is also a version with Service Pack 1. I had problems getting the file to work, so I recommend starting with the original and applying SP1 as a second step.
2. The SQL Server Developer Edition file is an ISO file. Double-click the file top open it. Double-click the Setup Icon.
