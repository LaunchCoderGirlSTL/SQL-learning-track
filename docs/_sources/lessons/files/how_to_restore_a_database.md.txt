# How to Restore a Database

These instructions cover how to restore a .BAK file to a SQL Server. NOTE: A file from a later version of SQL Server cannot be restored on an earlier version.

## Extract a ZIP file
If the backup file happens to be compressed, you will need to uncompress it first. Right-click on the zip file and select Extract All.

## Launch SSMS
SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) will be the main tool you will use in this course. Find it by typing SSMS in the Search window. Itâ€™s a great idea to pin SSMS to the taskbar so you can find it more easily later.
