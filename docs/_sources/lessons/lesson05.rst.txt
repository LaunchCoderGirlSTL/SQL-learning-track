Prep Work
---------

In-class Work
-------------
Written test given in class.

The `presentation <https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL/SQL-Materials/blob/master/Week%205/SSRS%20reports%20from%20scratch.pdf>`_ on SSRS will be helpful for creating SSRS reports from scratch.

Assignments
-----------
Read this `article <https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/reporting-services/sql-server-reporting-services-basics-building-ssrs-reports/>`_ from the "Creating Basic Reports" section down to Figure 25. To follow along with the article, you will find a zip file at the bottom. Download to your CoderGirl Media folder (NOT Downloads or Desktop, because SQL cannot see files in these locations.) Unzip the file and then restore the ReportingDemo.bak file. See the document from week 1 that shows how to restore a database.

The quiz in Canvas will ask you to create three reports. You will be asked to upload files.
